# Insight into Weekly Product Sales using Clustering
# Aim
To use data mining techniques to group the different products in the dataset into different sales groups.
# Data set
The weekly sales transaction dataset used for this work was obtained from the uci machine learning repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00396/). 
The weekly sales transaction dataset has 810 observations, each representing a product. For each product (observation) there are weekly sales record for a period of 52-week.
This implies that for each product, weekly sales values were tracked for a year. For 810 distinct products, it will be difficult to manually analyze what sales category 
(say high sales, or low sales) each product will fall to, hence the need for a data mining technique to help provide some insights into the data set.
